# Overview
This Power BI project visualises key business metrics for a fictional fitness club, focusing on trainer performance, membership trends, and customer engagement. The goal was to build a clear, interactive dashboard that allows managers to understand profitability, customer satisfaction, and marketing effectiveness at a glance.

>*Note: The original file is unavailable as this project was created using the web version of Power BI. However, all visuals and layout designs were created independently by me.*

## Design Considerations
The dashboard was designed to mimic a professional business intelligence report for gym management, with a clean interface and balanced use of visuals. Focus was placed on:
- Readable metrics and consistent alignment
- Visual storytelling (grouping profit and membership insights)
- Navigation-friendly layout for non-technical users
