# Overview
This project features a Power BI dashboard analysing sales performance for Tallaght Town Traders, a fictional organisation. It provides insights into total sales, budget variances, category breakdowns, geographic distributions, monthly trends, top-performing employees, and top products. The dashboard helps identify key metrics and patterns in retail data for bikes, clothing, and accessories.
>*Note: This dashboard was created prior to my adoption of GitHub for version control, and I no longer have access to the original dataset. The data was pre-cleaned and focused on sales, budget, product categories, geographic locations, and employee performance. All visualisations were built using Power BI's built-in features on the provided data at the time.*
