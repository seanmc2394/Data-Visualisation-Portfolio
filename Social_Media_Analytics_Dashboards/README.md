# Overview
This Tableau project analyses the social media and YouTube performance of **GoldCore**, an Irish precious metals investment firm.  
The goal was to design two professional dashboards, one comparing **GoldCore’s social media presence** with its competitors, and another offering a **deep dive into its YouTube analytics**.  
These dashboards were built to showcase data storytelling and visual communication skills using small but focused real-world data.  
> *Note: The dataset used for this project is not included, as it contains a small, privately provided sample of marketing metrics. However, all dashboard design, layout, and analysis were independently created by me in Tableau.*

## Dashboards

### Competitor Social Media Analysis
This dashboard compares GoldCore’s social media activity against three competitors: *Bullion By Post*, *Core Bullion Traders*, and *Merrion Gold*.  
It visualises:
- **Follower comparisons** across Twitter/X and LinkedIn  
- **Posting frequency** by platform  
- **Engagement differences** among competitors  
The layout emphasises clear comparison, brand colors for consistency, and intuitive readability for marketing teams.

### GoldCore YouTube Breakdown
This dashboard focuses on GoldCore’s YouTube channel performance.
It visualises:
- **Key KPIs:** Total Impressions, Views, and Average View Duration  
- **Top-performing videos** for the month  
- **Traffic sources**, showing where most views originated  
The dashboard combines KPI cards, color-coded tables, and bar charts for an engaging overview of content performance and reach.

## Design Approach
The dashboards were designed with simplicity, balance, and storytelling in mind:
- Consistent dark theme to highlight color-coded metrics  
- Clean typography for professional readability  
- Modular layout separating KPIs, visuals, and summaries  
- Limited color palette (orange, green, yellow) for strong brand consistency  
These choices mirror a real business scenario where dashboards are used by marketing and executive teams for quick, data-driven insights.
