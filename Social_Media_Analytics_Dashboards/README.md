# Overview
This project presents a visual analysis of GoldCore TV's YouTube performance using Tableau. It focuses on key engagement metrics such as views, watch time, traffic sources, and top-performing videos for February.
The dataset was provided pre-cleaned and contains a curated selection of metrics. My role focused exclusively on designing and building two Tableau dashboards that highlight:
- Overall channel performance (views, watch time, CTR, etc.)
- Traffic source breakdown
- Top-performing videos and their month-over-month changes
> *Note: The original Excel dataset is excluded due to its limited scope and formatting. All visualizations were built using this data, but the focus here is on the dashboards themselves.*
