# Overview
This Power BI project visualises healthcare data related to patient treatments, medications, and hospital charges.  
The goal of this dashboard was to build a clear, data-driven visual overview that allows healthcare professionals or administrators to understand **treatment costs**, **department performance**, and **disease distribution** at a glance.

> *Note: The original dataset used in this project is unavailable, as it was completed prior to setting up this GitHub portfolio. However, all visuals, layout, and calculations were created independently by me in Power BI.*

## Key Features
- **Cost Analysis by Department:** Comparison of total charges and treatment costs across hospital departments.  
- **Medication Breakdown:** Visual relationship between total charges and medication types.  
- **Disease & Condition Insights:** Total charges segmented by diseases, showing where the highest medical costs occur.  
- **Dynamic KPIs:** Visual cards tracking overall total charges and performance vs. goals.  

## Tools & Techniques
- **Power BI:** for all data visualisations and dashboard layout  
- **Excel:** for dataset storage and import  
- **Visuals Used:** clustered bar charts, pie charts, and matrix tables  

## Design Notes
The dashboard was designed to be **clear, informative, and executive-friendly**, using simple color contrasts and logical visual groupings:
- **Top section:** high-level KPIs for total and departmental charges  
- **Middle section:** disease and medication breakdowns  
- **Bottom section:** detailed cost table for reference  

Each element was chosen to make it easy for non-technical stakeholders to interpret key insights quickly.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data visualisation and layout design in Power BI  
- Understanding of KPI tracking and goal measurement  
- Business intelligence storytelling for healthcare use cases
